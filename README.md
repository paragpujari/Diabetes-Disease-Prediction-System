# Diabetes Disease Prediction System - A Machine Learning Approach

## Overview
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood due to the body's inability to produce or effectively use insulin. The condition can lead to serious health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision problems if not properly managed. Early diagnosis, lifestyle modifications, and proper treatment are key to managing diabetes and preventing complications. As AI tools continue to evolve  and find its application in medical and image diagnosis, it should be considered as a supportive tool and assist the clinicians in their assessments.



In this project,  we are using two Machine Learning models named as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines in detecting whether the particular person has diabetes or not based on the heath conditions provided in the dataset.
